# Structure of cross-species epigenome project
# Split according to main use cases



run_pipeline

	Prepare blank mapping [CreateBlank]
		Input: query species, chromosome sizes
		Output: blank signal files to be mapped on the cluster
		Initiate mapping on cluster manually, aggregate split files manually

	Process blank mapping [ProcessBlank]
		Input: blank mapping with overlapping regions
		Output: map file for query - target species pair with non-overlapping regions and fix resolution
		Annotate genome mapping (mapped fragments) files with conservation score; resolve conflicting regions
		(regions with overlaps) based on neighbour composition and conservation 

	Map epigenome [MapFiles]
		Input: signal tracks with fix resolution in simple bedgraph format, query - target species pair
		Output: mapped signal tracks with fix resolution in simple bedgraph format, bigWig output is optional

	Evaluate mapping
		Input:
		Output:

	Predict epigenome
		Input: peak tracks
		Output: model, prediction...?
