# Project outline


## Estimates based on gene orthology

__Prerequisites__:

- given two species A and B
- given a table of gene expression estimates for one or more biol. samples for species A and B
- given a table of gene orthologs between species A and B
- given a table of analogy information between biol. samples of species A and B

__Restrict__:

- select subset of orthologous genes between species A and B 

__Procedure__:

- map gene expression estimates from A to B and vice versa 

__Produce__:
