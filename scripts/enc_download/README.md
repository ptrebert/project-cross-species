# Preprocess - ENCODE download scripts

The scripts in this folder are meant for single execution to select appropriate datafiles from the ENCODE metadata annotation table (see annotation - datasrc - encode) and to download these files. For the actual processing, the content of this folder is irrelevant.
There is now support for using or adapting these scripts.
